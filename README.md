# 🚁 Drone Delivery Route Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview

We are working on solving the **Drone Delivery Route Problem** using different AI search algorithms.
The delivery area is represented as a **graph** (📍 nodes = locations, 🔗 edges = paths).
Each team member is responsible for one algorithm.

## 🎯 Project Goal

We will compare all algorithms based on:

* ⚡ Execution time
* 🧠 Memory usage
* ✅ Reaching a solution or not
* ⭐ Optimality of the solution
* 📈 Performance on small vs large graphs
